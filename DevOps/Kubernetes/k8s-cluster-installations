# Computer Basic Workflow

**Power On**
>[!TIP]
> **Power Supply**: Sends electricity to components. <br>
> **ROM**: BIOS/UEFI provides startup instructions. <br>
**BIOS/UEFI Initialization**
>[!TIP] 
> **POST**: Checks critical components. <br>
> **Bootloader**: Loads the Operating System (OS) into RAM. <br>
**OS Loading**
>[!TIP] 
> Loads OS from disk (HDD/SSD) into RAM. <br>
> Initializes the kernel, managing system resources. <br>
**CPU Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle**
>[!TIP] 
> **Fetch**: Retrieves instructions from RAM. <br>
> **Decode**: Understands actions to take. <br>
> **Execute**: Performs actions, like calculations and memory access. <br>
**Data Transfer via Buses**
>[!TIP] 
> Data moves between CPU, RAM, disk, and devices using buses. <br>
**Running Applications**
>[!TIP] 
> Loads applications into RAM for faster access. <br>
> CPU executes application instructions. <br>
**Memory Management**
>[!TIP] 
> Manages RAM usage and may use virtual memory when RAM is full.
**Multitasking and Process Management**
>[!TIP] 
> Manages multiple applications using task scheduling and interrupts.
**Device Interaction**
>[!TIP] 
> Communicates with hardware using device drivers.
**Program Execution and Resource Management**
>[!TIP] 
> Manages resources (CPU, memory) and file access.
**Program Termination and Cleanup**
>[!TIP] 
> Frees up memory and resources when applications are closed.
- Uses garbage collection to clear unused memory.

**System Monitoring**
>[!TIP] 
> Continuously monitors system performance (CPU, memory, disk usage).
