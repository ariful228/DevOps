# Explanation of the Process: <br>
**Client Request (kubectl / External Client):**<br>
The kube-apiserver serves as the frontend for Kubernetes. External clients (such as users or automated services) interact with the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl or other tools by sending REST API requests to the kube-apiserver. These requests can be for creating or managing resources like Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.

**kube-apiserver:**<br>
*Handles API Requests:* The kube-apiserver processes incoming requests and validates them. These requests may involve resource creation, updates, or status checks.

*Authentication & Authorization:* The API server handles authentication (verifying the identity of the requestor) and authorization (ensuring the requestor has the appropriate permissions) for all incoming API calls.

*Communication with etcd:* If the request requires changes to the cluster state (e.g., creating a new Pod or Service), the API server communicates with etcd to read or write data, ensuring the state of the cluster is stored persistently.

**Interaction with etcd, Scheduler, and Controller Manager:**<br>
*etcd: *The kube-apiserver interacts with etcd to read the current state of the cluster or write new information. For example, when a new Pod is created, its specification is stored in etcd.

*Scheduler:* When a Pod is created, the API server communicates with the kube-scheduler, which selects a node for the Pod to run on based on available resources and other constraints.

*Controller Manager:* The kube-controller-manager ensures the cluster’s desired state is maintained by interacting with the kube-apiserver and performing tasks like scaling or restarting Pods.

**Cluster State in etcd:**<br>
All changes or queries to the cluster's state, such as the creation of resources or monitoring their statuses, are reflected and stored in etcd. The kube-apiserver is responsible for ensuring this state remains consistent.


**Summary:**<br>
> Clients (kubectl/External) send API requests to the kube-apiserver.<br>
> The kube-apiserver handles these requests, authenticates them, and manages interactions with etcd (for cluster state)<br>
> Scheduler (for pod placement), and Controller Manager (for ensuring desired state).<br>
> etcd stores the cluster’s state, and the Scheduler and Controller Manager handle pod scheduling and cluster management tasks.<br>
