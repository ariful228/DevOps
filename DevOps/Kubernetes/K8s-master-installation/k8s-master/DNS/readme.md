# Explanation of the Process:
kube-apiserver:

The kube-apiserver watches for updates related to Kubernetes resources like Services, Endpoints, and Pods. When these resources are created, updated, or deleted, the API server notifies CoreDNS of the changes.
etcd (via the API server) holds information about all the services and pods in the cluster, including their IP addresses.
CoreDNS:

CoreDNS is the DNS server for a Kubernetes cluster, responsible for resolving DNS queries within the cluster. It runs as a deployment in the kube-system namespace.
It listens to DNS requests from other services and Pods within the cluster, and responds with IP addresses for Kubernetes services, pods, or external DNS queries.
CoreDNS uses configuration files (Corefile) to define how it should handle DNS queries, including forwarding external queries to public DNS servers.
Cluster DNS Requests:

Internal DNS Requests: CoreDNS resolves DNS requests within the cluster. For example, if a Pod makes a DNS query to reach another service (myservice.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local), CoreDNS will respond with the correct IP address of that service.
External DNS Requests: If a Pod makes a DNS query for an external resource (e.g., google.com), CoreDNS can forward this query to external/public DNS servers like Google DNS or any configured external DNS provider.
DNS Query Processing:

Internal DNS (Cluster Resources): When a Pod or Service requests an internal resource (such as another Pod or Service), CoreDNS checks its local data (collected via the kube-apiserver and etcd) and resolves the DNS query with the appropriate Pod or Service IP address.
External DNS: If the DNS query is for an external domain, CoreDNS forwards the request to a public DNS server (e.g., Google's 8.8.8.8) and returns the result to the querying Pod or Service.
Cluster Networking:

After CoreDNS resolves the DNS query, the clusterâ€™s networking infrastructure (typically managed by kube-proxy and network plugins like Calico or Flannel) routes traffic between Pods, Services, or external resources based on the resolved IPs.
Summary:
CoreDNS is the DNS server for Kubernetes clusters, handling internal and external DNS requests.
It receives updates from the kube-apiserver about services, endpoints, and pods and uses this information to resolve internal DNS queries for Kubernetes resources.
CoreDNS handles:
Internal DNS resolution for Pods and Services, mapping names to internal IP addresses.
External DNS forwarding for domains outside the cluster, forwarding queries to external DNS servers.
